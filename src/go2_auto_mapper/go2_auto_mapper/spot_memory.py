Remember open spots the robot scanned from, for getting unstuck.

A spot is recorded when the robot finishes its 360 degree scan there and the
lidar's closest return is at least `min_clearance` away: the robot has just
proven it can stand and turn there. When the explorer gets stuck it goes back
to the most recent spot that the current SLAM map still shows as open, before
falling back to the nearest open space on the map (open_space.py). No ROS, so
it can be tested on its own.
