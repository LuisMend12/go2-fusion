"""
Diary of the explorer's navigation, one line per goal.

A diary of the explorer's navigation: where each goal was, how it ended and how much new map it
really showed, plus the moments it got stuck.

It keeps track of a run for people reading it afterwards, and it is the training data for
fine-tuning a VLM: the camera view toward a goal, labeled by what walking there actually revealed.
Writes goals.jsonl and one JPEG per goal to a folder; with the VLM on, also decisions.jsonl and a
map snapshot per VLM ranking, so each choice can be scored afterwards. No ROS here, so it tests on
any machine. A failed write warns and never stops the robot's exploring.
