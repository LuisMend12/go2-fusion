Ask a YOLO server on a GPU machine for boxes, instead of running YOLO here.

The server is host_tools/yolo_server/server.py, reached over an SSH tunnel like
the auto mapper's VLM. Pictures are shrunk before sending (YOLO looks at 640
pixels anyway) and the boxes are scaled back to the full picture.

No ROS here, so it tests on any machine.
